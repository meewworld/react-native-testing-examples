# Mock Data
Often in a test environment the same mock data is used over and over ex. states saved in redux. This data is centralised in the [mockData folder](../../src/testing/mockData/index.ts). Another element which is used many places is the [navigation prop](../../src/testing/mockData/Navigation.ts).
